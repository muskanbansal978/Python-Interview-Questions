# Python-Interview-Questions
This includes all questions asked to me in a Python Interview.

Question 1: Arrange the numbers +ve and -ve numbers alternatively. if any of them is absent, add all the leftover numbers as is.

Question 2: Create a high order function to sum the elememts of a list (The list can be nested).

Question 3: Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
